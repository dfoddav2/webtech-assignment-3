# webtech-assignment-3
This is the repository for the third assignment in WS23/24 Web Technologies course, which is about Node.js.

It is a basic Node.js application where the data and images of users are displayed dynamically using EJS.
New users can be Created, Edited, and also Deleted.

One change to the original assignment is the addition of persistant memory, through an external JSON file, separate from the list in usesrsModule.

## How to run
1. Open the project directory.
2. Run "npm install" - to install neccessary packages.
3. Run "node app.js" - to start the node application.
